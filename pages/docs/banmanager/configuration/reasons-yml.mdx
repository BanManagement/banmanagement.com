Setup shortcuts for reasons to punish players quickly. Use the below examples like `/ban confuser #hacking` which will ban the player for the reason `Using a hacked client`.

You can combine multiple shortcuts or append/prepend them to reasons, e.g. `/ban confuser #hacking & #swearing` will ban the player for `Using a hacked client & Swearing in chat`.
