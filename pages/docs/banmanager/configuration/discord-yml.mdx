Allows sending messages to Discord server channels when a punishment occurs. Bukkit requires [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/) and Sponge requires [MagiBridge](https://ore.spongepowered.org/Eufranio/MagiBridge).

| Platform | Location |

| BungeeCord | Unsupported |

<div className="config-info">

- ###### `enabled` - Set to true to enable discord integration, defaults to `false`
- ###### `messagesFromActor` - Set to true to show punishment messages as if they were sent by the minecraft user, defaults to `true`
- ###### `punishments`
  - ###### `ban`
    - ###### `channel`
    The Discord channel name (for `DiscordSRV`) or ID (for `MagiBridge`) of the Discord channel.
    For `DiscordSRV`, this name must specified under `Channels` in your DiscordSRV config.yml, i.e.
    ```json
    # The first part of channel pairs is not the Discord channel name!
    Channels: {"global": "219559668236681217", "punishments": "221419146028646402"}
    ```
    - ###### `message` - Supports [Discord Markdown](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-), use `\n` to represent a new line
    - ###### `ignoreSilent` - Set to false to send silent punishments, defaults to true
