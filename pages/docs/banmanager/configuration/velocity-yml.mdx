Configuration options specific to the Velocity proxy platform.

| Platform | Location |
| -------- | -------- |
| Velocity | `/plugins/BanManager/velocity.yml` |

<div className="config-info">

- ###### `features`
  - ###### `commands` - Set to `true` to enable BanManager commands on Velocity. Defaults to `true`.
  - ###### `forceEnableMute` - Set to `true` to force enable mute functionality without requiring [SignedVelocity](https://modrinth.com/plugin/signedvelocity). Defaults to `false`.

</div>

## Mute Support

Due to Minecraft's signed chat system introduced in 1.19.1+, intercepting and blocking chat messages on a proxy requires special handling. BanManager on Velocity supports mutes in two ways:

1. **With SignedVelocity plugin** (recommended) - Install the [SignedVelocity](https://modrinth.com/plugin/signedvelocity) plugin on your Velocity proxy and the corresponding mod on your backend servers. This allows proper interception of signed chat messages.

2. **Force enable** - Set `forceEnableMute: true` to enable mute functionality without SignedVelocity. Note that this may not work correctly with signed chat on 1.19.1+ servers.

## Example

```yml
features:
  commands: true
  forceEnableMute: false
```

## Notes

- This configuration file only exists on Velocity installations
- Other configuration files (`config.yml`, `messages.yml`, etc.) work the same as on other platforms
- Report functionality is not available on Velocity
