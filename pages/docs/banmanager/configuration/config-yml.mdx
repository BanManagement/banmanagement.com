<div className="config-info">

  - ###### `mutedCommandBlacklist`
    Muted players will be blocked from using commands within this list. Command aliases will automatically be found and blocked, e.g. `msg` will block `tell`. **Do not prefix** commands with `/`.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    mutedCommandBlacklist:
    - msg
    ```
  - ###### `softMutedCommandBlacklist` - identical to `mutedCommandBlacklist` but only affects players who are soft muted
  ---

  - ###### `duplicateIpCheck`
    Displays a warning to those with `bm.notify.duplicateips` permission when a player joins with the same IP as a banned player, defaults to `true`.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    duplicateIpCheck: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `bypassDuplicateChecks`
    A list of IPs to exclude from the banned player duplicate check.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    bypassDuplicateChecks:
    - 0.0.0.0
    - 127.0.0.1
    - '0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1' # IPv6 supported
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `logKicks`
    Records players kicked from the server via `/kick`, defaults to `false`.

    Use the command [/bminfo <player\> -kicks](/docs/banmanager/commands) to view these records.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    logKicks: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `logIps`
    Records when a player leaves and joins the server, along with their ip address. Defaults to `true`. If set to `false`, only the most recent IP address will be stored. For GDPR compliancy, you may wish to purge data older than a certain period of time; see [cleanUp](#cleanup) for further information.

    Use the command [/bminfo <player\> -ips](/docs/banmanager/commands) to view these records.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    logIps: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `displayNotifications`
    Broadcasts punishments to players with [bm.notify.X permissions](/docs/banmanager/permissions?search=bm.notify), defaults to `true`.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    displayNotifications: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `broadcastOnSync`
    Broadcasts a notification when new punishments are synced between the database and server, defaults to `false`.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    broadcastOnSync: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `timeLimits`
    Generates a permission to limit the time period a player can issue a punishment for. Once configured, assign the player with the appropriate permission e.g. `bm.timelimit.X.Y` where X is the punishment type and Y is the custom name you have defined.

    **Example**

    Based on the following configuration, granting a player the `bm.timelimit.playerBans.Moderator` permission will only allow them to `/tempban` a player for up to 1 day:
    ```yml
    timeLimits:
      playerMutes:
        Moderator: 1h
      playerBans:
        Moderator: 1d
      playerWarnings:
        Moderator: 30d
      ipBans:
        Moderator: 1d
      ipMutes:
        Moderator: 1d
      rollbacks:
        Moderator: 1d
      nameBans:
        Moderator: 1d
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `cooldowns`
    To prevent duplicate punishments against a player in quick succession, set a cooldown to limit the time in seconds before a player can be punished again. Set to 0 to disable. Defaults to 10 seconds.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    cooldowns:
      ban: 10
      tempban: 10
      mute: 10
      tempmute: 10
      banip: 10
      tempbanip: 10
      warn: 10
      tempwarn: 10
      report: 10
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `warningActions`
    Execute a list of commands against a player when they reach a warning point threshold. By default, a single warning is worth 1 point. Use the `-p` flag when warning a player to change this, e.g. `/warn confuser -p 5 Hacking`.
      - ###### `enabled` - Set to `true` to enable, defaults to `false`
      - ###### `actions`
        - ###### `<number of points>`
          - ###### `cmd` - The command to execute upon reaching the number of points, the following tokens are available: `[player]`, `[playerId]`, `[actor]`, `[reason]`, `[id]`, `[points]`.
          - ###### `delay` - Optional, specify a delay in seconds of when to run the command, defaults to `0` and executes immediately.
          - ###### `pointsTimeframe` - Optional, specify a [timeframe](/docs/banmanager/commands#time-format) to only trigger the command if the total accumulated points was reached within the past timeframe. For example, setting this to `30d` means the total number of points accumulated in the past 30 days must equal `<number of points>` in order for this command to trigger.

    **Example**

    The following will mute a player immediately and ban a player after 10 seconds upon reaching a total of 5 warning points:
    ```yml
    warningActions:
      enabled: true
      actions:
        '5':
        - cmd: ban [player] [reason]
          delay: 10
        - cmd: mute [player] [reason]
        '6':
        - cmd: ban [player] [reason]
          delay: 5
          pointsTimeframe: 30d
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `warningMute`
    Forces players to type the reason of their most recent warning before being allowed to speak in chat again. Note: **removed on server restart or when player leaves**. Defaults to `false`.

    **Example**
    ```yml
      warningMute: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `hooks`
    Allows running commands before and after a punishment.

      - ###### `enabled` - Set to `true` to enable, defaults to `false`
      - ###### `events`
        - ###### `<event>` - One of: `ban`, `tempban`, `unban`, `mute`, `tempmute`, `unmute`, `warn`, `tempwarn`, `ipban`, `tempipban`, `unbanip`, `iprangeban`, `tempiprangeban`, `unbaniprange`, `note`, `report`
          - ###### `<when>` - Either `pre` to run before the punishment is issued or `post` to run after the punishment is issued
            - ###### `cmd` - The command to execute, available tokens are dependent on event type:
              - ###### ban - `[player]`, `[playerId]`, `[actor]`, `[reason]`
              - ###### tempban - `[player]`, `[playerId]`, `[actor]`, `[reason]`, `[expires]`
              - ###### unban - `[player]`, `[playerId]`, `[actor]`, `[reason]`, `[expires]` if a temporary ban or `0`

    ```yml
    hooks:
      enabled: true
      events:
        ban:
          pre:
          - cmd: kick [player] [reason]
            delay: 10
          - cmd: banip [player] [reason]
          post:
          - cmd: broadcast [player] banned
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `checkForUpdates` - deprecated and currently unsupported in `v7`
    ---

  - ###### `offlineAutoComplete`
    Enables auto completing offline player names when issuing BanManager commands, e.g. typing `/ban c` and then <kbd>tab</kbd> will suggest all players beginning with the letter `c`. Note, this is case-sensitive.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    offlineAutoComplete: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `punishAlts`
    Automatically applies punishments to alts (players who share the same IP address) on join. Defaults to `false` as this could block siblings or those on shared internet connections.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    punishAlts: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `denyAlts`
    Automatically prevents players joining if the same IP address is associated with a ban

    **Example**
    ```yml
    denyAlts: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `timeAssociatedAlts`
    Time in seconds a player's IP address should be classified as an alt of another player. Defaults to `0` for an IP address to always be associated to a player

    **Example**
    ```yml
    timeAssociatedAlts: 604800
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `cleanUp`
    Keep records for a defined number of days. Specify 0 to never delete. `playerHistory` requires [logIps](#logips) to be enabled and only purges IP addresses that are not currently IP banned.

    **Example**

    The following will keep a history of kicks for 30 days and ban records for 10 days. All other records are kept indefinitely.
    ```yml
    cleanUp:
      kicks: 30
      banRecords: 10
      ipBanRecords: 0
      ipMuteRecords: 0
      muteRecords: 0
      readWarnings: 0
      unreadWarnings: 0
      playerHistory: 0
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `maxOnlinePerIp`
    The maximum number of players allowed to connect from the same IP address. Set to `0` to disable. Defaults to `0`.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    maxOnlinePerIp: 1
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `maxMultiaccountsRecently`
    The maximum number of players allowed to connect from the same IP address (recently logged in). Set to `0` to disable. Defaults to `0`. Set `multiaccountsTime` to specify the time range in seconds.

    **Example**

    The following only allows a player to join the server if nobody has joined the server with the same IP address in the past 5 minutes (300 seconds):
    ```yml
    maxMultiaccountsRecently: 1
    multiaccountsTime: 300
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `checkOnJoin`
    Queries the database for new player punishments when a player attempts to join. BanManager stores a cache of punishments in memory and frequently queries the database for changes; this is sufficient for single servers.

    For networks, enabling this can remediate delays in punishments syncing between servers. Defaults to `false` as this could become a performance bottleneck against the database when there are spikes in players joining. Before enabling this, try changing the [schedules.yml](schedules-yml) sync task options.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    checkOnJoin: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `createNoteReasons`
    Enables creation of notes based on text in between `( )`. E.g. `/ban confuser testing (too good)` will ban for `testing` and create a note `too good`. Defaults to `false`.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    createNoteReasons: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `onlineMode`
    If you are using bungeecord set to online mode, leave this as `true`. If you are using an offline mode server, set this to `false`; this will cause BanManager to use case-insensitive UUIDs for player lookups, i.e. `Confuser` and `cOnFuSer` will be identified as the same player. Defaults to `true`

    **Example**
    ```yml
    onlineMode: true
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `chatPriority`
    BanManager will attempt to block muted players from chatting. However, some chat plugins can intefere with this causing messages to still display. Change the priority accordingly. Defaults to `normal`.

    The following options in order of priority are available: `lowest`, `low`, `normal`, `high`, `highest`, `monitor`.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    chatPriority: high
    ```
    ---

  - ###### `blockInvalidReasons`
    Prevents executing commands with an invalid reason, i.e. missing from [reasons.yml](reasons-yml). E.g. `/ban confuser #speel-erorr` will return an error message instead of banning the player for `#speel-erorr`. Defaults to `false`.

    **Example**
    ```yml
    blockInvalidReasons: true
    ```
