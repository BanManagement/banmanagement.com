A full guide for installing, configuring and running BanManager for use in production on a Minecraft Server

## Prerequisites
- Java 8+
- [CraftBukkit/Spigot/Paper](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) or [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/downloads/) for Minecraft 1.7.2+

---

## Initial Setup
1. Download the BanManager jar from our [downloads page](/download) and save it in an easily accessible location
    * If you're not sure which version you need, try our [configuration builder](/docs/banmanager/config-builder)
1. Copy the BanManager jar file to your server `plugins` folder (CraftBukkit/Spigot/Paper) or `mods` folder (Sponge)
1. Fully restart your minecraft server
    * This is required to generate the default configuration files
1. Check your server logs to confirm BanManager enables correctly

### Setup shared database (optional)
By default, BanManager stores its data in a file backed in-memory database named [H2](https://www.h2database.com). This is sufficient for most servers and allows the plugin to work out-of-the-box. However, if you would like to share data, e.g. across a network or use the WebUI, a remote database such as `MySQL` or `MariaDB` is required.

Once the database is setup/configured, you should have a hostname, a database name, and a username and password.

Open `config.yml`, find `databases` and under the `local` section, set `storageType` to `mysql` or `mariadb`. Then populate `host`, `name`, `user` & `password` with your connection details.

Save the file and then restart your minecraft server. Check the server logs to confirm the plugin has enabled correctly.

## FAQ

### Startup Issues

#### BanManager is showing as red in /plugins
Please ensure you have configured the plugin correctly and check either your server log or console for more information

#### When trying to /ban a player it displays /ban <player\> <reason\>
The plugin is not enabled, please check your server startup log for more information

#### BanManager is unable to connect to the database
This can be caused by a number of issues, below lists the most common. If these do not resolve your issue, feel free to request [Support](/support).
- Ensure you have created the database. Verify this by logging in with the user you are connecting with (via mysql -p -u) and running `SHOW DATABASES;`. If the database is not contained in the results, it either has not been created or the user does not have permission to access it.
- If you are connecting to the database from another server, you need to explicitly grant access to it for the remote ip address as follows: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dbname.* TO username@'IP' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';` replacing dbname, username and password with your respective details. Then run `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;` to ensure they are updated.
- If after verifing the aforementioned checks the plugin is still unable to connect, check the MySQL/MariaDB error logs.
