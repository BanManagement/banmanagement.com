Learn how to upgrade the BanManager WebUI with just a couple of steps.

---

## First, make a full backup
Whenever doing an update it’s a good idea to take a full backup of your site first. If anything goes wrong, you’ll still have all your data.

## Update to the latest version
This guide assumes your BanManager-WebUI installation is located in `/home/banmanager/BanManager-WebUI`, please replace where applicable.

Run the following commands in order:

1. `cd /home/banmanager/BanManager-WebUI`
1. `git rev-parse HEAD` to make a note of your current version (in case you need to rollback)
1. `git pull` to fetch the latest version
1. `npm ci --production` to install the latest dependencies
1. `npm run heroku-postbuild` to build the latest pages and run database migrations
1. Restart the process - dependant on your setup

## Troubleshooting any problems
If something goes wrong, you can always revert to the previous version.

1. `node bin/run undo` to revert database migration changes
1. `git checkout <commit>` to checkout the source of a previous version, replace `<commit>` with the short hash noted from `git rev-parse HEAD` command prior to updating, e.g. `git checkout 56fe206`
1. `npm ci --production` to install the old dependencies
1. `npm run build` to build the old pages
1. Restart the process - dependant on your setup

If you’re still having trouble, start by searching the [BanManager Discord](https://discord.gg/59bsgZB) to see if your issue has come up before.
