A full guide for installing, configuring and running BanManager WebUI for use in production.

## Prerequisites
The recommended installation requires the following stack:
- BanManager configured to use MySQL or MariaDB
- MySQL or MariaDB (this can be the same database used above but must be accessible)
- Git
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS
- NGINX or equivalent (for SSL)
- A server with at least 1GB memory
- A registered domain name

---

## Initial Setup
There are two parts, the Minecraft plugin which enables web only features and the UI which renders the page and provides a GraphQL API.

### BanManager-WebEnhancer
This is a required plugin which enables web only features.

1. [Download](https://ci.frostcast.net/job/BanManager-WebEnhancer/) and add the jar to your compatible server. The [source code](https://github.com/BanManagement/BanManager-WebEnhancer) is also available.
1. Edit BanManager's [messages.yml](/docs/banmanager/configuration/messages-yml), and add a `[pin]` token to the `ban.player.disallowed` & `tempban.player.disallowed messages`
    ```yml
    ban:
      player:
        disallowed: '&6You have been banned from this server for &4[reason] \nUse [pin] to appeal'
    tempban:
      player:
        disallowed: '&6You have been temporarily banned from this server for &4[reason] \n&6It expires in [expires] \nUse [pin] to appeal'
    ```
1. Restart the server or enable BanManager-WebEnhancer plugin and execute `/bmreload`

## WebUI
Create a directory on your server for your installation. This can be a different server than your Minecraft server (as long it can connect to the MySQL database). We'll name it `banmanager` in this example but you can use whatever you like.

```bash
mkdir /home/banmanager
cd /home/banmanager
```

### Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BanManagement/BanManager-WebUI.git
```

### Install
```bash
cd /home/banmanager/BanManager-WebUI
npm ci --production
```

Once dependencies have been downloaded and installed, run the setup command:
```bash
npm run setup
```

#### Setup Questions
During the installation, the CLI will ask a number of questions to configure the application. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to use the default value. If you make a mistake during the installation process, simply exit the setup (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> OR <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>) and run it again.

The CLI will generate a `.env` file containing the necessary environment variables in order for the application to run. This will automatically be used on start up. If you do not wish to use this, simply remove the file and pass in the environment variables yourself when running the process.

##### `Contact Email Address`
On setup, tokens are generated to enable push notifications. This is a requirement from vendors in order to contact you if this functionality is abused. This should be an email address that can receive mail.

##### `Database Host`
This should be the host of the database used to setup web specific tables such as logins. This can be the same database used by the BanManager Minecraft plugin, but it does not have to be. The setup process will create the tables for you.

##### `Database Port`
As above, this will default to 3306

##### `Database User`
As above. Ensure this user has permissions to create tables.

##### `Database Password`
As above

##### `Database Name`
As above

##### `Add BanManager Server`
You will be prompted to specify details of your BanManager plugin database connection details. If tables are not found or the connection fails, you will be reprompted the question again.

##### `playerPins table`

This is the name of the table which contains login pins. By default this is set to bm_player_pins and is the value within your BanManager `config.yml` file.

##### `playerReportLogs table`
This is the name of the table which contains report log data. By default this is set to bm_report_logs and is the value within your BanManager `config.yml` file.

##### `serverLogs table`
This is the name of the table which contains report log data. By default this is set to bm_server_logs and is the value within your BanManager `config.yml` file.

##### `Console UUID`
BanManager generates a UUID to use when punishing players by the console. This can be found in your [console.yml](/docs/banmanager/configuration/console-yml) file. This record must exist.

##### `Server Name`
Like the legacy UI, you can name servers in order to differentiate between where punishments occurred. This is useful for multi-server setups. This can be whatever you like.

##### `Your Email Address`
Set this to an address you wish to use to login with. This does not need to be the same email address as your Mojang account.

##### `Your Password`
Set this to a value you wish to use to login with. This should **not be the same password as your Mojang account**. If you forget this password, you can login using a pin generated in-game via `/bmpin` command (requires BanManager-WebEnhancer).

##### `Your Minecraft Player UUID`
This is required to setup your login and associate your data. If you're not sure what this is, use a lookup tool such as https://mcuuid.net/ to lookup your online UUID.

#### Run
The following environment variables are required and should have been generated by the previous setup step.

```bash
CONTACT_EMAIL
ENCRYPTION_KEY
SESSION_KEY
NOTIFICATION_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY
NOTIFICATION_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY
DB_HOST
DB_PORT
DB_USER
DB_PASSWORD
DB_NAME
```

If you are not using the .env file, you must pass these variables yourself in the next steps.

Next run the systemd command below to run the UI as a service. This will ensure it runs in the background and automatically restarts. You may be prompted to provide a password for sudo access. This is expected and the commands that will be executed will be provided beforehand.
```bash
npx bmwebui setup systemd
```

If you do not have systemd, you can use an alternative such as [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2). Note that this is not covered by the installation guide.

It is highly recommended to use a web server such as NGINX to provide HTTPS support and defend against a number of common web attacks. Certificates for HTTPS can be obtained freely via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). To help with this, another setup command can be used to configure NGINX via HTTP.

First install NGINX if you haven't already:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx
```

Next run the setup command:

```bash
npx bmwebui setup nginx
```

#### NGINX Setup Questions

##### Domain
This will be how you access the website. You are expected to have registered a domain name and configured the DNS to point to your server. Without this, the WebUI will not function as expected.

##### Subdirectory
If you want to run the UI on an existing domain rather than a separate domain or subdomain, please provide the path here. A new environment variable of `BASE_PATH` will be added to your `.env` file. Please restart the UI (if via systemd above run `sudo systemctl restart bmwebui.service`) and re-run the `npx bmwebui setup nginx` command once completed.

Once this is completed, the UI should be available over HTTP. Try it out! Next, we need to secure the site via HTTPS to prevent attackers eavesdropping on pins/passwords that are entered into the UI.

#### Let's Encrypt Setup
First install CertBot. This is used to manage and rotate certificates.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install certbot
```

Once installed, run the following command to automatically generate a certificate and update your NGINX configuration. Ensure to replace `example.com` with the domain you chose in the setup previously.

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com
```

That's it! Now head over to your UI domain and login.
