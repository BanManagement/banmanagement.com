This will import bans and ip bans from Minecraft's in-built banning system.

## Prerequisites
- BanManager setup on your Minecraft server

## Migration
Run the following command either in-game or via your Minecraft server console:

`/bmimport players`

BanManager will begin importing ban data. You will be sent a message once completed.

Check the Minecraft server console for any potential issues with the import.

To import ip bans, follow the same steps but use the following command:

`/bmimport ips`
