This will import bans, ip bans, mutes and warnings from [AdvancedBan](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedban.8695/)

## Prerequisites
- BanManager setup on your Minecraft server

## Migration
Run the following command either in-game or via your Minecraft server console:

`/bmimport advancedban 127.0.0.1 3306 databaseName username password`

Replace the command arguments with your database connection details for AdvancedBan, e.g.

`/bmimport advancedban 127.0.0.1 3006 banmanager survival mypass`

BanManager will begin importing data from AdvancedBan. You will be sent a message once completed.

Check the Minecraft server console for any potential issues with the import.
