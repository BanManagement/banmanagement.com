## Global Commands
These commands are only available if the global database option within your config is enabled. They are only for syncing bans across multiple servers, and do not have as granulated permissions.

The time it takes for each action to take affect depends on the interval your global scheduler is set to within `schedules.yml`. Default is **2 minutes**.
